# Homegrown

Homegrown is an extensible language written in JavaScript.

## Status

**Before using homegrown for your project!** Homegrown is still in a very early and experimental stage. This means the language specification and behaviour is prone to be changed. 


## Uses
Homegrown was inspired by [Airscript](https://airtable.com/developers/scripting).  
As such, the intended use-case for homegrown is as a dumbed-down scripting API to embed inside web-applications.
